You've joined a community of thousands of Do-It-Yourself scientists, collaborating to make spectrometry more accessible!

To help you stay in touch, we've invited you to the Public Lab Spectrometry mailing list (http://publiclab.org/lists); it's a great place to:

* ask for help
* share what you're working on
* find others who are doing similar work

Again, welcome, and hope to see you on the list!

Best,
